question,expected_answer
"What are the main drivers of global warming?","Human activities, principally emissions of greenhouse gases like CO2 and methane, unsustainable energy and land use, changed lifestyles, and consumption and production patterns across regions and countries."
"How has the global temperature changed since 1850?","Global surface temperature increased by about 1.1째C between the periods 1850-1900 and 2011-2020, with faster warming since 1970 than any previous 50-year period in the last 2000 years."
"What are the projected impacts of 1.5째C global warming?","Increasing severity of weather extremes, heatwaves, droughts, flooding, sea-level rise, health hazards, risks to food and water security, economic impacts, societal disruptions, and widespread ecological damage."
"Which regions are most vulnerable to climate change impacts?","Vulnerable developing countries and regions, particularly those with the poorest populations, face disproportionately severe impacts from climate change, including compounded risks and unequal distribution of damages."
"What is the remaining carbon budget to limit warming to 1.5째C?","From 2020, the estimated remaining carbon budget to limit warming to 1.5째C with a 50% likelihood is approximately 500 GtCO2, with a potential range between 300 to 600 GtCO2 based on non-CO2 warming control."
"What are the key mitigation strategies to limit global warming?","Rapid, deep, and in most cases immediate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions across energy, industry, transport, buildings, and urban sectors, achieving global net-zero CO2 around the early 2050s."
"How does afforestation help in mitigating climate change?","Afforestation contributes indirectly by enhancing carbon sinks. Achieving net-negative emissions through carbon dioxide removal, including practices such as afforestation, balances residual emissions from hard-to-abate sectors."
"What are the main barriers to climate change adaptation?","Current financial, governance, and institutional arrangements do not comprehensively address required climate adaptation needs and barriers, particularly in highly vulnerable developing countries with limited capacity and resources."
"What is the role of international cooperation in climate action?","International cooperation provides essential governance frameworks, financial resources, institutional support, and policy mechanisms to effectively mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and address adaptation gaps globally."
"How can climate-resilient development be achieved?","Integrating ambitious climate mitigation and adaptation with sustainable development goals, emphasizing equity, justice, proactive governance, and careful consideration of risk management and co-benefits."
"What are the potential synergies between climate action and sustainable development?","Simultaneous advancement of sustainable development goals occurs through climate action, yielding improved public health, reduced vulnerabilities, food security, poverty alleviation, economic stability, energy access, and biodiversity conservation."
"What are the trade-offs of climate mitigation and adaptation?","Climate mitigation and adaptation involve economic trade-offs, uneven effects across society, development goal conflicts, substantial upfront investments, technological uncertainties, employment changes, and socio-economic transitions requiring careful management."
"How can climate finance be mobilized for adaptation and mitigation?","Through strengthened international cooperation, governance frameworks, clearer commitments, innovative funding and financial mechanisms, targeted resource allocation, and supportive incentives addressing adaptation gaps and emission reductions."
"What is the importance of integrating climate action across sectors?","Cross-sectoral integration enhances policy effectiveness, consistency, and resource optimization in addressing climate goals, facilitating co-benefits and creating enabling conditions supporting broader sustainable development outcomes."
"What are the key actions needed in the near term to address climate change?","Immediate deep and sustained greenhouse gas emissions reductions across all sectors, rapid transitional strategies, accelerated adaptation implementation, strengthened international support and proactive policies are urgently needed."
"How can climate education and awareness contribute to climate action?","(Not specifically addressed in the uploaded IPCC file. Thus, no explicit extracted answer is provided for this question based strictly on uploaded content.)"
"What is the role of technology in climate mitigation and adaptation?","Technology is essential in enabling rapid emission cuts through energy transition, efficiency improvements, carbon capture and storage, and supporting robust adaptation infrastructure, operational interventions, and carbon dioxide removal measures."
"How can climate governance support effective climate action?","Effective climate governance establishes structured targets, transparent and inclusive decision-making processes, robust policy frameworks, enhanced collaboration, clear responsibilities, accountability measures, and coherent integration across scales and sectors."
"What are the benefits of climate action for human health?","Climate action benefits human health by reducing mortality and morbidity from increased temperatures, extreme weather events, compromised food and water security, vector-borne diseases, and mental health impacts caused by climate-sensitive conditions."
"What is the importance of equity in climate action?","Ensuring equity in climate action is critical, as climate impacts disproportionately affect vulnerable populations historically least responsible for emissions, and fair outcomes greatly influence the effectiveness of overall climate strategies."
